**These refurbished Go React examples mark the revival of [this project](https://github.com/bep/gr/). I still think client code in Go looks really nice, so I wanted to show off ... the code.**

I put it on ice some time ago, waiting for GopherJS to mature, waiting for someone (including myself) to come up with a seamless and solid pattern for what I think about as _data transfers_ -- both between server and client, but most importantly between the Go and JavaScript "world".

I even wrote a [blog post](http://bepsays.com/en/2016/10/13/react-in-go/) about it. Now it is time to see if I can take it the last mile.

Oh, and this site is built with the great [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) -- look at the [latest commits](https://github.com/bep/bego.io/commits/master) in the [bego.io GithHub repo](https://github.com/bep/bego.io/) to look at the source for this demo.
